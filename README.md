# Photo Storage App (Frontend)

This is the **frontend** for the Photo Storage App, built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It provides a user-friendly interface for uploading, viewing, and managing photos. The backend is separate, so make sure to connect the app to your API endpoints for full functionality.  

> ⚠️ Note: This is just the frontend. You will need to set up the backend and update API links in the code to fully use the app.
